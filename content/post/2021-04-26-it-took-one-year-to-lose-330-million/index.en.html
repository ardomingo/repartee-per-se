No man is an island entire of itself; every man<br>
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; <br>
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe<br>
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as<br>
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine<br>
own were; any man’s death diminishes me,<br>
because I am involved in mankind.<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom<br>
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.<br>

<p>Between 2020 and 2021, we lost 330 million years. The average life expectancy of someone living in the United States declined by 1.5 years (78.8 to 77.3 years). Collectively, that’s <strong>495,000,000</strong> years among all of us.</p>

<p>Treatment: This should be a featured piece that examines the number of years lost (in terms of the ~year decrease in average life expectancy) by everyone. First looking at it as a whole, as in - one year from each living American adds up to 330 million years, from the deaths of 565,000+ of us. But how has it affected some of the cities of America? How many years have the big cities lost, the hardest hit cities, red cities, blue cities? How can I frame this to show more of the human toll of this pandemic?</p>
<p>Graph of “Years Lost by City/Metro” - would probably best represented by ‘cost per year’ of how many deaths in that city leading to city population times decrease in avg life expectancy.</p>
